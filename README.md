#CSC 1304 Practical Skills Development  - Makerere University

Guildliness
Students will be required to work in groups of upto five (5) members per project. The project should address a practical challenge and must involve some level computation and innovativeness. Below we provide a guide:

Characteristics of a Computer Science project:

solves a real-world challenging problem

Includes multiple APIs

has  “state” or “history,” e.g. doing something twice in a row does not necessarily produce an identical output


reflects creative use of available resources

amuses, delights, excites, or surprises its users

strikes a fair balance of challenging  and feasibility with a reasonably achievable outcome

involves communication or interaction with an external server or other systems

Some examples (these just examples):

An example project could be building a system that identifies the persons vulnerable to COVID-19, accepts donations and payouts to those in need using MTN Mobile API. In addition the system use the Google maps API to show the locations of the vulnerable people. 
A system that enables persons with visual impairment to interact with mobile money system using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API and  Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
Using Twitter API to build a Tweet bot that tweets about the daily weather updates for Kampala based on a Weather API 
A mobile app or an embedded systems project for detecting car crashes using sensors  embedded in a smartphone or autonomous sensors.
